Write a program that uses a function called Output_Array_Info.
Output_Array_Info Properties:
Input Parameters:
1. A pointer to an integer called array_ptr. This will be used to point to an array of integers.
2. An integer that stores the size of the array.
Steps Taken inside of the Output_Array_Info function:
1. Output every integer value for the array that array_ptr is pointing to. Do not use brackets
([]) to output the integer values. Use the indirection operator (*).
2. Output every memory address location for the array that array_ptr is pointing to. Use the
indirection operator (*) not brackets ([]).
The main function will perform the following steps:
1. Declare an array of 5 integers called numbers.
2. Declare a pointer to an integer called pointer.
3. Have pointer point to the numbers array.
4. Pass pointer and the size of the array as parameters to the Output_Array_Info function.
